                    Bootstrap can be boiled down to three main files:

                    bootstrap.css – a CSS framework
                    bootstrap.js – a JavaScript/jQuery framework
                    glyphicons – a font (an icon font set)
                    Additionally, Bootstrap requires jQuery to function. jQuery is an extremely popular and widely used
                    JavaScript library, that both simplifies and adds cross browser compatibility to JavaScript.

                    Everything else you might happen across while studying the Bootstrap documentation – Grunt, Gulp,
                    Sass, LESS, bower, npm, etc – is not necessary to get started with Bootstrap. These are task
                    runners, preprocessors, installation aids, and package managers, so don’t be discouraged if you
                    don’t know how to use any of them yet.
